   textAreaString: `These are just a few ways that one might use the random sentence generator for their benefit. If you're not sure if it will help in the way you want, the best course of action is to try it and see. Have several random sentences generated and you'll soon be able to see if they can help with your project.
              Our goal is to make this tool as useful as possible. For anyone who uses this tool and comes up with a way we can improve it, we'd love to know your thoughts. Please contact us so we can consider adding your ideas to make the random sentence generator the best it can be.`,
